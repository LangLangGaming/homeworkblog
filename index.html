        <p><span style="font-size:100px; font-family:'Balsamiq Sans';color:red"> T</span>he most extended vacation I've
            ever had was
            three
            days. During the
            most
            recent school holiday though, I took a five-day vacation totaling one thousand kilometers on the road.
            The vacation was a camping trip at Cameron Highlands, then on the way back we had a night at Genting
            Highlands,
            It was cold.</p>
        <p> This vacation began on the 26th of August, 2023, 7;30 p.m. when me and my family left our home in Johor
            Bahru
            and drove 290km to the city of Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, where we stayed at an Airbnb. My dad didn't want
            to
            drive to Cameron Highlands all in one shot, so we decided to stay there. The following day, we left
            Nilai
            and drove the remaining 200 kilometers to Tapah, Perak, where we began our ascent to Tanah Rata, Cameron
            Highlands.</p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0);font-family:Open Sans;text-decoration:underline">DAY TWO: THE ADVENTURE
            BEGANS
        </h2>
        <p> Finally, 3 hours and 250 kilometers later, we arrived at campsite number one of Hola Campsite, Cameron
            Highlands at 4pm. Initially, I thought I would be sick for the entire day, but that went out the window
            when
            I left the car. The calm mountain wind immediately got rid of any nausea in me. We started setting up
            our
            camp. Setting up took some time, but organizing all our bags inside the tent was why it took hours.</p>
        <p> After that, we headed for dinner at a local restaurant and then to the very popular Golden Hills Night
            Market, which is just a stone's throw away from our campsite. We brought a lot of food, mainly fruits,
            and
            some others including corn, cheesy wedges, and other food items I cannot remember due to me having the
            greatest brain of all time. These food items were then brought back to the campsite, where it was
            devoured
            by a hungry Chinese family. I have to tell you, the fruits are delicious. Especially the grapes. They
            taste
            sweeter than the stuff we buy here. I was very surprised when I first tasted them and I ate basically
            nothing other than grapes.</p>
        <p>Originally, when my dad told me that it would be very very very cold during nighttime. I didn't really
            think
            much of it as I went to Cameron Highlands before last year. But, oh boy was I wrong. I think it peaked
            at
            16C, which, if you're a Western reader, might think it's nothing. But I live in Asia, where the
            temperature
            averages 40C. So yeah, it was really cold. I personally had to learn this the hard way as 2 shirts and a
            pair of long pants were not enough to keep out the cold. I proceeded to wake up in the middle of the
            night
            multiple times because it was too cold. At 7 a.m. we woke up, but while waking up, my leg muscles
            started
            cramping. This unfortunately caused my leg to hurt when I put it on the ground, so, to minimize that, I
            ended up walking like someone who has a broken leg for most of the evening. </p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0);font-family:Open Sans;text-decoration:underline">DAY THREE: A NOSTALGIC
            ROADTRIP
            AROUND CAMERON HIGHLANDS</h2>
        <p> That morning, after a quick breakfast, we began moving our camp over to campsite number two, the reason
            being another group of campers had booked the entire campsite number one, and campsite number two was
            full
            yesterday. For the rest of this blog, I will just write "campsite number one" and two to just number
            one.
            Now, some people had packed and left, so we were able to move to number two. This, unfortunately, took
            way
            longer than I anticipated. The hardest part was moving the actual tent. As we didn't want to pack the
            tent
            up and reassemble it at number two less than a hundred meters from number one. This, however, was easier
            said than done. Even with all hands on deck, it took us approximately half an hour to pack up parts of
            the
            tent so it was easier to transport, including the vestibule and outer layer, move it over to number two,
            and
            reassemble everything. </p>
        <p>We woke up and 7-8 a.m. ( i forgot), and by the time we were done, it was twelve. So after making sure
            everything was in place, we left campsite number two and went down Golden Hills in search of some
            much-needed food. After much debate, we settled at a Malay restaurant for lunch. I ordered a plate of
            spaghetti bolognese and it was unexpectedly good. The mushroom soup, however, tasted like milk and there
            was
            no mushroom smell. I think they put too much milk in the soup and ended up just serving me milk. Either
            way,
            it was a disaster, and I didn't drink any.</p>
        <p> After lunch, we went to visit some popular Cameron Highlands attractions. All of them I already visited
            during my graduation trip and I've already documented that in a video which I will link to at the bottom
            of
            this blog. So, I won't be going into much detail. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we only managed to visit two of them because there was a huge traffic jam, mainly because
            it's the holidays, and the first of them was the Time Tunnel, a history museum about Cameron Highlands.
            There was a huge traffic jam between Tanah Rata and Brinchang, so it turned what we thought was a
            relatively
            quick 20-minute drive into a whopping two hours! This was one of the main reasons we only managed to
            visit
            two attractions, the other being the fact that there were traffic jams on almost every road in
            Brinchang,
            mainly because most of the attractions are there. </p>
        <p> I was honestly surprised by the fact that there is almost no one in Time Tunnel, as it was quite famous.
            After buying our tickets, we went in. I was honestly surprised by the fact that there are almost no one
            in
            Timeu Tnnel, as it was quite famous in Cameron Highlands. When we went in, a wave of nostalgia hit me.
            The
            last time I was here it was jam-packed with students. Now, walking into this empty place, a wave of
            loneliness also hit me. As I said, i won't be going through much detail, but it is a long hallway filled
            to
            the brim with historical artifacts and pictures. We spent quite some time in there, and when we emerged,
            it
            was raining. After a coconut water break, we left for what can be considered the highlight of the day,
            Cameron Lavender Garden, Brinchang. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact time we arrived due to my brain with the computing power of
            an
            Intel Pentium processor, but it was in the radius of four pm to five. Anyway, we brought tickets and
            went
            in. When we stepped in, a magnificent sight greeted my eyes. Patches upon patches of flowers I could not
            name went on as far as the naked eye could see. Each patch was a different color so it made it so when
            you
            look at the entire thing from above, it looked like a rainbow. After looking at the pretty flowers, we
            went
            upstairs to the strawberry self-pick section, which I convinced my father it was worth a shot.</p>
        <p>' After we finished picking, we ate them on the spot, and that was when we realized one box wasn't enough
            as
            we gobbled that thing up in seconds. So, me and my mum went back and picked another 2 boxes. This was
            when
            my dad realized it was worth listening to me once in a while. I knew those strawberries tasted good
            because
            I tried them last year. I believe this was the main event of the entire day. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, we couldn't linger any longer as the place was set to close at 6. So we quickly left. For
            dinner that night, we had steamboat at Mountain House Charcoal Steamboat Restaurant, which,
            coincidently,
            was the exact same place we had steamboat a year ago during my graduation trip. My dad ordered some
            chicken
            soup and tomato soup and it was delicious. The only thing missing in this scenario was my friends. The
            place
            felt really empty without them. I sent a few pictures to the group chat and that immediately reminded
            them
            of the trip and they started chatting about the cringe photos they took there, mainly of one particular
            guy
            named Edmond. There were so many cringe photos of him in this restaurant that I even did a few
            reenactments.
            This was, I believe the most nostalgic moment of the entire trip. </p>
        <p>After the very nostalgic dinner, we hopped back in the car and drove the twenty-ish minutes back to the
            campsite. On the way we once again stopped at the night market to pick up some grapes and corn for
            supper
            that night. This concludes day number three....</p>
        <p>Or was it?</p>
        <p>I had unfortunately forgotten to explain something very crucial that had kept me awake. You see, the
            place
            actually had a decent phone signal coverage, better than I was expecting. So, I decided to start a
            WhatsApp
            group call with my friends. We talked for hours about a few topics. I remember one of my friends saying
            their school had a daily bag-checking procedure. This made me very grateful that I picked Foon Yew High
            School, the current school I studied at, as teachers don't check your bag every day. Another friend
            mentioned that his cocurricular activities time was replaced by extra Chinese classes. This made me feel
            bad
            as while I was using the computer in an air-conditioned lab during my Micro Computer Society classes, he
            was
            sitting in a classroom listening to a teacher teaching him Chinese. I left the call at 12 a.m. to
            finally
            hit the sack, as my phone was almost drained of battery. </p>
        <p> Since I had almost frozen to death last night, I came prepared tonight. First, a shirt, then my pajamas,
            and
            finally a thick jacket. Then I applied a heat pack on my chest, which surprisingly was the main reason I
            did
            not get turned into a block of ice that night. Despite all this, it was still pretty cold, so I put on
            my 2
            layer blanket. This worked surprisingly well and I was able to stay warm the entire night.</p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0);font-family:Open Sans;text-decoration:underline">DAY FOUR: ONE TO ANOTHER
        </h2>
        <p> Last night, I think it was my right leg that experienced muscle cramps. This time, however, my left leg
            started cramping. I do not know why that happened but thank god it was our last night at Cameron
            Highlands
            so I didn't have to sleep another night and risk another muscle cramp. This once again made me have to
            half-walk and jump for the entire morning. We quickly packed up and left the highlands at 10 p.m. </p>
        <p> The reason why we left was, that our next destination was Genting Highlands, another famous highlands,
            but
            this one was based on entertainment. We had to arrive early so we could have more time to explore and
            play.
            Originally, we had planned to take Federal Route 59 down to Tapah, where we were supposed to go to Kuala
            Lumpur because my dad had an appointment there. Fortunately, that appointment was canceled to tomorrow,
            and
            so we went down what I believe is Route 102, and then we used a few mountain highways to get to Genting
            Highlands. Around twelve, we stopped near Raub for lunch which consisted of roti prata and maggi. It was
            simple yet quite delicious.</p>
        <p> Around 4pm, we finally arrived at Genting Sempah, Genting Highlands after a 3-hour drive. We immediately
            began our ascent. This time, however, I managed to keep any motion sickness in check, as I was listening
            to
            songs, mainly classical. The road we took was only 17km, but it was much steeper and there were many
            steep
            and sharp turns we had to overcome. Fortunately for us, my dad is driving a 4x4, which was able to
            easily
            navigate through the sharp and steep turns with hardly any problem. The 17km road, was much shorter but,
            due
            to its steepness, it still took us almost an hour to navigate through it. </p>
        <p> We arrived at 5pm and immediately set course to First World Hotel. Interestingly, my father thought we
            checked into a hotel named Resorts World, which I don't think exists. We drove around and around for a
            few
            minutes until I saw the receipt and corrected him. </p>
        <p> After this rather strange situation, we finally parked our car in the correct hotel. The moment I
            stepped
            out of the car, I was immediately hit with a blast of cold wind. It was blowing for the duration we were
            in
            that carpark and it was cold, really cold. It wasn't this windy in Cameron Highlands, so I was
            surprised. We
            grabbed our luggage and headed up to the hotel lobby.</p>
        <p> Once all the check-in procedures were performed, we headed to our room at Tower B. The rooms were a bit
            small, but still a cosy haven. There were only 2 things I wasn't very pleased. First is the fact that I
            only
            had one freaking bar of signal, and second is we didn't get a window with a good view. But other than
            that,
            it was very comfy, definitely on par with a hotel that holds the record for the hotel with the most
            rooms.
        </p>
        <p> After checking our rooms and unpacking our luggage, we headed down to explore. We visited the indoor
            theme
            park and other stuff. After that we headed to a noodle restaurant for dinner. I unfortunately could not
            recall the name of this particular restaurant because I have a brain the size of an atom. The noodles
            tasted
            great though.</p>
        <p> After that dinner, we headed to the main highlight of the day, also known as the very famous Genting
            Bowl, a
            bowling alley 2000m in the sky. On the way there, we stopped at an archery range, and my dad decided to
            let
            me try it out. Let's just say, I am not an archer. None of the 20 arrows I was given hit the bullseye,
            which
            was expected. The bow was also very heavy and I am just glad i still have my hand after holding that
            thing
            to my nose for like 5 seconds twenty times. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience. The staff
            were
            very kind and they taught me how to shoot a bow, which, until now, I was only able to do in Minecraft.
        </p>
        <p> After this unplanned activity, we entered Genting Bowl. It was quite expensive, as one game costed 72
            MYR
            for 4 persons. We played 2 games.</p>
        <p> Once my dad had paid and we reached our specified lane, we started the game. During the first few
            rounds, I
            kept rolling gutter balls, but as the game progressed, the number of times I rolled gutter balls
            decreased
            significantly. The first game wasn't that interesting, as none of us rolled a strike. This changed in
            the
            next round when I became the first to roll a strike in my second chance. My dad quickly caught up and a
            few
            rounds later he rolled a double strike. My brother, in that round, was the complete opposite of us. I
            think
            he had a 5 round streak where he kept rolling gutter balls and didn't get any marks for that. My dad and
            I
            were the more professional and skilled bowlers, although he still got twice the marks I had. In my
            opinion,
            bowling is one of my favorite sports and I was the most excited when we started. After the eventful two
            games, we went and got supper. I remember my father ordered a sausage bread for him and me at a shop,
            but
            the guy just gave us sausages without the bread. When my father saw this, he proceeded to yell I mean
            communicate nicely with the man until he gave us the correct order. We had some porridge and afterward
            we
            headed back to the hotel.</p>
        <p> When we returned, I took a shower and a poop. After that, despite the one-bar phone signal, I called my
            friends once again. Needless to say, the call did not go smoothly. Many times I got disconnected and my
            friends couldn't hear me. The call lasted way shorter than yesterday, as my brother was already asleep
            and
            my mother was also forcing I mean asking nicely for me to go to sleep. I very reluctantly ended the call
            and
            hit the sack.</p>
        <p> This time, It wasn't as cold as I thought. I had a good sleep ( better than the previous night). We
            awoke at
            9 a.m. the next morning (once again my Intel Pentium brain has failed me in remembering the time we
            woke),
            brushed our teeth, and went down to breakfast. </p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0);font-family:Open Sans;text-decoration:underline">DAY FIVE: THE RETURN</h2>
        <p> Our breakfast this time was a hotel buffet. I have never tried the breakfast here in Genting as every
            time
            we were here we normally went to the mall to get breakfast. The funny thing is, my father declined the
            breakfast option when we checked in. As a result, we had to pay more when we bought the ticket on the
            spot.
            It was a lovely morning and we got a window table, which made up for the fact we didn't get a window
            room. I
            got some porridge and some orange juice. It was a great breakfast.</p>
        <p> After we returned to the room, it was a rush to pack everything, as the check-out time here in First
            World
            Hotel was 11am, one hour earlier than the normal hotels whose check-out time was 12am. After we checked
            out,
            we visited Genting Skyworlds Theme Park, a very popular theme park that had just opened in Genting
            Highlands. We didn't go inside to play, though, as we just intended to take a look since we didn't have
            much
            time due to my father's aforementioned appointment. </p>
        <p> We left Genting Highlands at one p.m. After we arrived, my dad headed to his appointment to pick up
            something. Unfortunately, it was during this period of time that the strawberries we brought down from
            Cameron Highlands finally succumbed to the 30C heat of downtown Petaling Jaya, and finally spoiled. My
            dad
            noticed this after he got back to the car. Thankfully, the grapes were still intact. At this point of
            time,
            it was 4-5pm and we were extremely hungry from the drive down Genting Highlands, so we went on a hunt
            for
            food. Unfortunately, we were not able to find any, so we ended up just settling our lunch at nearby
            McDonalds.</p>
        <p> This was unfortunately the end of the trip. We arrived back home just past 8:30p.m and we were able to
            find
            dinner at a nearby restaurant that hadn't closed. After that, we returned to our beloved home after
            leaving
            it five days ago.</p>
        <p> Now, you may be wondering. I returned home on the 30th and I posted this blog why I post this blog one
            week
            later? You see, exams were around the corner and my computer had been taken away by my mother, who only
            let
            me use it a few times a week for checking WhatsApp as she also took my phone the moment we got back. It
            was
            during those few minutes I managed to write a few lines of this blog. I really wanted to get this blog
            out
            before the exams, which would commence on the 11th.</p>
        <p> Lastly, I didn't include any photos in this blog because I didn't have time to transfer them from my
            phone
            before it was confiscated, and I didn't know how to do that too. I will try to insert photos in my next
            blog.</p>
        <p> And after 3000 words, I conclude my blog. Welp, back to studying for the exams. Bye I guess.
